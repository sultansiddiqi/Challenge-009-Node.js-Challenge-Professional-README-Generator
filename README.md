## Installation

It is important to install the inquirer to allow this to work. The command "npm i inquirer" will allow you to do that. Then simply running the application after downloading it is to use the command "node index.js" in your appropriate location.

## Usage

In order to use this project, one must download the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

Then open the terminal from the root of the files and type in "node index.js", then answer the questions to the best of your abilities. 

After all the questions have been answered the README will be generated to the output folder where it can be edited further.
